# Hex-Color-Lighten-Darken
This project is a color lighten/darken tool that allows you to input a hexadecimal color code and use a slider to adjust the lightness or darkness of the color. The tool also provides the altered color code in real-time. The interface includes a toggle button to switch between lightening and darkening the color and a preview of both the original and altered colors. This tool was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
